# SkyFi-like adaptor prototype

This is a proof of concept of a device that allows controlling a Sky-Watcher
SynScan equatorial mount from SkySafari running on a smartphone.

As a bonus, this device would display current coordinates on a 16x2 LCD dot
matrix display.

This project is an attempt to snoop into serial dialog, detect getPreciseRaDec
commands and convert then display RA and Dec on a LCD Display.
